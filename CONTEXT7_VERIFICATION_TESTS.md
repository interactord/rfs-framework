## Post-Deployment Verification Tests

### Level 1: Basic Functionality (Critical)
These tests must pass immediately after deployment:

1. **Version Query Test**
   - Query: "What is the latest version of RFS Framework?"
   - Expected: "4.6.1"
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

2. **Library Existence Test**
   - Query: "Tell me about RFS Framework"
   - Expected: Should return framework information
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

3. **Basic Features Test**
   - Query: "What are the core features of RFS Framework?"
   - Expected: Should list result pattern, dependency injection, etc.
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

### Level 2: v4.6.1 Specific Features (High Priority)
These tests verify the new v4.6.1 features are properly documented:

4. **ResultAsync Fixes Test**
   - Query: "What runtime warning fixes are in RFS Framework 4.6.1?"
   - Expected: Should mention coroutine caching, 'coroutine already awaited' fix
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

5. **Performance Improvements Test**
   - Query: "What performance improvements are in RFS Framework 4.6.1?"
   - Expected: Should mention 15-20% improvement, caching mechanism
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

6. **Bug Fixes Test**
   - Query: "What bugs were fixed in RFS Framework 4.6.1?"
   - Expected: Should mention async_success/async_failure variable reference fixes
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

### Level 3: Technical Details (Medium Priority)
These tests verify technical implementation details:

7. **Caching Mechanism Test**
   - Query: "How does the ResultAsync caching mechanism work in RFS Framework?"
   - Expected: Should explain _get_result() helper method, caching logic
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

8. **Compatibility Test**
   - Query: "Is RFS Framework 4.6.1 backward compatible?"
   - Expected: Should confirm 100% backward compatibility
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

9. **Helper Methods Test**
   - Query: "What is the _get_result() method in RFS Framework?"
   - Expected: Should explain internal caching helper method
   - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

### Level 4: Legacy Features (Low Priority)
These tests verify existing features still work:

10. **HOF Library Test**
    - Query: "What HOF patterns are available in RFS Framework?"
    - Expected: Should list compose, pipe, curry, etc.
    - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

11. **Server Startup Utilities Test**
    - Query: "What are the server startup utilities in RFS Framework?"
    - Expected: Should mention import validation, type checking, auto-fix
    - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

12. **Reactive Streams Test**
    - Query: "Does RFS Framework support reactive programming?"
    - Expected: Should mention Mono, Flux, reactive streams
    - Status: ‚è≥ Pending

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success (Must Pass)
- ‚úÖ Tests 1-3 (Basic Functionality) all pass
- ‚úÖ Tests 4-6 (v4.6.1 Features) at least 2/3 pass
- ‚úÖ Library information is accurate and current

### Full Success (Ideal)
- ‚úÖ Tests 1-9 (Critical + High + Medium Priority) all pass
- ‚úÖ Tests 10-12 (Legacy Features) at least 2/3 pass
- ‚úÖ All documentation links work correctly
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics are accurate

### Failure Criteria (Requires Rollback)
- ‚ùå Test 1 (Version Query) fails
- ‚ùå Test 2 (Library Existence) fails
- ‚ùå More than 2 Level 1-2 tests fail
- ‚ùå Major inaccuracies in library information

## Rollback Plan

If verification fails:
1. Restore previous configuration: `cp context7_v4.6.0_backup.json context7.json`
2. Redeploy previous version through Context7 MCP
3. Document issues in rollback report
4. Fix configuration issues
5. Retry deployment

## Test Execution Timeline

- **Immediate (0-5 minutes)**: Tests 1-3
- **Short-term (5-30 minutes)**: Tests 4-9
- **Extended (30-60 minutes)**: Tests 10-12
- **Quality Assurance (1-24 hours)**: Full integration testing
